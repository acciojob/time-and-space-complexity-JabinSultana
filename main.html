	 <h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps determine whether a solution is efficient and scalable for large inputs. Writing code with good Time complexity ensures better performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm in relation to the input size. Space Complexity is often expressed using notations like O(n), which represents linear memory usage depending on input size.
